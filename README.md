# Required settings

## Setup Github account
Go to https://github.com and make yourself an account. Github is what we usually use for our online repositories. Make yourself a profile picture and ask one of our administrators to add you to our UTADA organization. 

## Setup a command-line terminal
### Linux & Mac
Open the `Terminal` app. Done.
### Windows (**WSL**)
If you use Windows, I assume you use Windows 10. Then you may follow this instruction: https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10   
This will install Windows Subsystem for Linux (**WSL**) for you. It is very useful in software development on Windows.   
Follow the steps until you reach the `Uninstalling Linux distros using Settings` section (plz don't uninstall). Now you should be able to use Ubuntu (A distribution of Linux) on Windows 10. 

*Note that your windows files are under /mnt/. You can use `cd /mnt/c` to access your files in Disk C:*

*Note: I strongly recommend to use a terminal emulator for your Ubuntu if you are on Windows. Examples: [Terminus](https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/), [Hyper](https://hyper.is/), [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)*

## Install git
### Linux
git is built-in in any Linux distributions.
Type `git --help` in terminal to double-check.
### Mac
(TO BE FILLED BY DINO)
### Windows
If you followed the terminal setup above, then you should have git built-in in your WSL

## git basic usages

## git pull requests

# Optional settings

## Install Vscode
https://code.visualstudio.com  
Vscode is one of the easiest and multi-purpose IDEs/text editors, for web front-end, JavaScript, Python, C/C++ and more. If you don't know how to start, you can start from it. 

## Install node.js & npm
### Linux & WSL

### Mac
